            <h2>Food</h2>

            <img src="img/food.png" alt="Bowling" class="img-thumbnail float-right"/>
            <p class="lead">One a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
                That wasn't her toe. Hello. Nein dizbatcher says zere iss problem mit deine kable. Dude, please!â€¦ Is this your homework, Larry? Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour. You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me.</p>
            <p class="lead">The house-elves at Hogwarts amongst other duties provide all food to students and staff. They cook a wide variety of dishes especially at the feasts. The various dishes are prepared in the kitchens directly below the Great Hall. Within the kitchen are four long tables directly aligned with the house.</p>
            <h2>Dress Code</h2>
            <img src="img/dress.png" alt="dress" class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead m-2">The Hogwarts uniform is the clothing that students attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are required to wear.
                The uniform must be worn every day in every lesson, and kept on while in the Great Hall, Study Hall, Common Room or Library. Students may wear casual clothing when they have the day, or the rest of the day, free.
                The uniform is washed in the laundry, which is located somewhere in Hogwarts Castle and presumably operated by house-elves.</p>
            <h2>Discipline</h2>
            <img src="img/greathall.jpg" class="img-thumbnail float-right">
            <p class="lead">Apart from losing points from a house, serious misdeeds at Hogwarts are punishable by detention. Whenever a student loses a house point, their house jewels (ruby for Gryffindors, emeralds for Slytherin, sapphires for Ravenclaw, and topazes for Hufflepuff) are taken away from a glass hourglass located in every classroom. The same goes for adding points to the specific house, although the teacher or prefect must conjure the gems from thin air.</p>
            <p class="lead">On designated weekends, Hogwarts students in their third year or higher, with a signed permission slip, are permitted to walk to the nearby wizarding village of Hogsmeade, where they can relax and enjoy the pubs, restaurants and shops. There appears to be a good relationship between the school and the village, and the students get on well with the locals. Favourite places in Hogsmeade include Honeydukes Sweetshop, Zonko's Joke Shop, clothing stores such as Gladrags Wizardwear, the Shrieking Shack (regarded as the most haunted building in Britain),
                the pubs The Three Broomsticks and The Hog's Head, and Madam Puddifoot's coffee shop.</p>
