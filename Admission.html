                    <p class="lead">According to the Novels, Admission to Hogwarts is selective,
                        in that children who show magical ability will automatically gain a place,
                        and squibs cannot attend the school as students (though they can work there in other roles, as Argus Filch does).</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">A magical quill at Hogwarts detects the birth of magical children and writes their names into a large parchment book,
                        but there is no admission test because "you are either magical or you are not."
                        Every year, a teacher checks this book and sends a letter to the children who are turning eleven.
                        Acceptance or refusal of a place at Hogwarts must be posted by 31 July. The letter also contains a list of supplies like spell books,
                        uniform, and other things that the student will need. The prospective student is expected to buy all the necessary materials,
                        normally from shops in Diagon Alley,
                        a concealed street near Charing Cross Road in London that can be found behind the wizarding pub, The Leaky Cauldron.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5"> Students who cannot afford their supplies can receive financial aid from the school,as happened with the young orphan Tom Riddle.Letters to Muggle-born witches and wizards,
                        who may not be aware of their powers and are unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world,are delivered in person by a member of Hogwarts staff, who then explains to the
                        parents or guardians about magical society,and reassures them regarding this news.Though the school is in Great Britain, its catchment area is the wider British Isles,
                        as Irish students can also attend.Each student is allowed to bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad. Along with the acceptance letter,first-year students are sent a list of required equipment which includes a wand, subject books, a standard size 2 pewter cauldron,
                        a set of brass scales, a set of glass or crystal phials, a kit of basic potion ingredients (for Potions), and a telescope(for Astronomy). The Hogwarts uniform consists of plain work robes in black, a plain black hat, a pair of protective gloves,and a black winter cloak with silver fastenings. Each uniform must contain the wearer's nametag.
                        First years are not allowed a broomstick of their own, though an exception to this rule is made for Harry in his first year afterhe demonstrates an excellent ability as a Seeker in Quidditch.</p>

                        <p>The Hogwarts letter is a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, sent to British wizards and witches prior to their first year at Hogwarts. A special quill exists, which writes down the name of every magical child in Britain at the time of their birth. This allows Hogwarts letters to be sent to all magical children at the appropriate time, even those who are Muggle-born.</p>

                        <p>The Hogwarts letter consists of a note of acceptance from the Deputy Headmaster or Headmistress of Hogwarts. This note is written in green ink and is accompanied by a list of required textbooks and materials for the upcoming school year.
                            The letter is written on parchment paper and delivered to the recipient by owl, except in the case of Muggle-borns. When a student is Muggle-born the acceptance letter is delivered in person by a member of the Hogwarts faculty. The faculty member acts as a special messenger, who explains everything to the student and parents.Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</p>
